## VirtualTourist
Project created as part of Udacity iOS Nanodegree - Project 4: Virtual Tourist App

## Project Description

Virtual-Tourist is an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.



##Installation

To run the app open it on xcode and build.
