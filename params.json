The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.\r\n\r\n##Design\r\n* Utilized Flickr restful API to generate local pictures\r\n* Worked with other iOS Developers to create an App that generates local picture by dropping pins on a tourist map.\r\n\r\n###Privacy Policy of\r\n\r\nIn order to receive information about your Personal Data, the purposes and the parties the Data is shared with, contact the Owner.\r\n\r\n* Data Controller and Owner\r\n\r\n* Types of Data collected\r\n\r\n* The owner does not provide a list of Personal Data types collected.\r\n\r\nOther Personal Data collected may be described in other sections of this privacy policy or by dedicated explanation text contextually with the Data collection.\r\nThe Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or collected automatically when using this Application.\r\nAny use of Cookies - or of other tracking tools - by this Application or by the owners of third party services used by this Application, unless stated otherwise, serves to identify Users and remember their preferences, for the sole purpose of providing the service required by the User.\r\nFailure to provide certain Personal Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services.\r\n\r\nUsers are responsible for any Personal Data of third parties obtained, published or shared through this Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.\r\n\r\nMode and place of processing the Data\r\n\r\n### Methods of processing\r\n\r\nThe Data Controller processes the Data of Users in a proper manner and shall take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.\r\nThe Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated.

Unless stated otherwise, the then-current privacy policy applies to all Personal Data the Data Controller has about Users.\r\n\r\n###Information about this privacy policy\r\n\r\nThe Data Controller is responsible for this privacy policy, prepared starting from the modules provided by Iubenda and hosted on Iubenda's servers.\r\n\r\n### Definitions and legal references\r\n\r\n### Personal Data (or Data)\r\n\r\nAny information regarding a natural person, a legal person, an institution or an association, which is, or can be, identified, even indirectly, by reference to any other information, including a personal identification number.\r\n\r\nUsage Data\r\n\r\nInformation collected automatically from this Application (or third party services employed in this Application), which can include: the IP addresses or domain names of the computers utilized by the Users who use this Application, the URI addresses (Uniform Resource Identifier), the time of the request, the method utilized to submit the request to the server, the size of the file received in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the server's answer (successful outcome, error, etc.), the country of origin, the features of the browser and the operating system utilized by the User, the various time details per visit (e.g., the time spent on each page within the Application) and the details about the path followed within the Application with special reference to the sequence of pages visited, and other parameters about the device operating system and/or the User's IT environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Flickr Data Storage\r\n\r\nIf you don't need to back up the CoreData store, i.e., it only contains information downloaded that can be downloaded again, and doesn't contain any user content or settings, then, I would recommend you place the CoreData store in the app's cache directory instead of the documents directory. \r\nStoring CoreData files in the cache directory is common practice when CoreData is being used as a cache. That's exactly what that folder is for. \r\nSee: lists.apple.com/archives/Cocoa-dev/2005/Jul/msg02544.html for more info. \r\n\r\n### No Back-up to iCloud \r\nThe cache folder's contents are not backed up to iCloud.\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/36882094/ios-app-rejection-due-to-data-storage-guidelines\r\n\r\n### What We are not doing\r\nBecause we are downloading images to Cache Directory Folder. Nothing is stored at Documents Folder.\r\nWhen placing the CoreData store in the Documents folder, it could create additional files (binary files, log files etc), and these can grow quite large. Applying the NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey flag on the main store.\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/17083894/do-i-have-to-reupload-the-binary-after-an-appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n###Flickr \r\n\r\nFlickr does have 3 safety flags you can apply to an image:\r\n\r\nSafe\r\nModerate\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\n\r\nFlickr have an API for reporting objectionable content\r\nto find more information, please see here: https://info.yahoo.com/safely/us/yahoo/flickr/\r\n\r\nAlthough people are advised to upload images with the correct safety flag already applied, sometimes they upload everything as \"safe\" and they change the safety flags after upload. This may be what happened in your case.\r\n\r\nThe Flickr rules apply only to what parts of the body are visible, and have nothing to do with \"adult\", \"art\", or \"porn\" designations. People are not required to flag these images as private. \r\n\r\nIf breasts or buttocks are visible in the image, (including tight or translucent clothing) then the image must be flagged as \"moderate\".\r\nIf the pubic area is visible or sexual acts are shown, the image must be flagged as \"restricted\". \r\n\r\n\r\n### More on Flickr and Yahoo\r\n\r\nHow can I remove content that isn’t suitable for all ages from my search results?\r\n\r\nNot a problem! SafeSearch is a tool that lets you control what comes up in your searches on Flickr. It's already turned on by default.\r\n\r\nWhen you first join Flickr, you’re account SafeSearch default is “safe”. You can however choose to see “moderate” content as well. Moderate? Moderate photos and videos may feature naked breasts and bare bottoms, but nothing more. Here how to make that change:\r\n\r\nIf you aren't signed in to Flickr, SafeSearch is always on.\r\nIf you are signed in, you can change SafeSearch included content that the community has flagged as “moderate”.\r\nIf you’re signed in, you can also set a default SafeSearch level that you'd like to use.\r\nYou can change this setting for each search on the Advanced Search page.\r\nNote: If you are in Singapore, Hong Kong, or Korea, you will only be able to view safe content based on your local Terms of Service — you won’t be able to turn SafeSearch off.\r\n\r\nAnd just a reminder: Be sure to report abuse if you spot any inappropriate photos or videos!\r\n\r\nA few more tips:\r\n\r\nYour Web address can’t be changed. Once you’ve made up your own personalized web address, you can’t change it.\r\n\r\nFlickr video. You can post videos up to 90 seconds long if the content is “safe or moderate.” If you upload a video, it must be a video you created. If Flickr finds out you uploaded a restricted video or a video you didn’t create, the video will be removed and you’ll receive a warning. Not cool. If you regularly upload content that isn’t yours, you may not be able to upload anymore. If you’re a repeat abuser, your account may be deleted.\r\n\r\nCopyright infringement. OK, let’s say you find photos or video that you’ve taken in someone else’s Flickr account. A lot of times, people don’t understand copyright and might have uploaded your stuff in error. Or, you can contact the Yahoo Copyright Team about filing at Notice of Infringement. Click on the “Copyright” link that’s available in the footer of ever page to find out how so your message will go to the correct Yahoo Copyright people.\r\n\r\nHow can I report a problem I see on Flickr?\r\n\r\nIt’s super easy. Try the Report Abuse link at the bottom of every page. Use it to report obscene language, offensive content, threats of violence, harassment, or anything else that violates either the Yahoo Terms of Service or Flickr’s Community Guidelines. If you click that link when you’re on the page where the content is, we’ll get the info we need to best take action.\r\n\r\nFlickr’s Abuse & Advocacy Team will take action as needed. They could even deactivate an abuser’s account. Yahoo’s legal team gets involved right away with reports that show child pornography or solicitation of a minor. When needed, they report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\r\n\r\nWhat else can I do to use Flickr more safely?\r\n\r\nStart by checking out our general tips for online safety. There’s a bunch of good ones, including protecting your online identity, keeping your passwords secret, being cautious about contact with strangers, and creating a family pledge for online safety. For your own safety, get to know these features and add a parent or another trusted adult as a Flickr friend so they can see what’s up.\r\n\r\nYahoo is committed to providing a safer online experience for all of us, and it complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Flickr has a number of safety features to limit your risks. However, protecting all of us is a responsibility we share with parents, teachers, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### User\r\n\r\nThe individual using this Application, which must coincide with or be authorized by the Data Subject, to whom the Personal Data refers.\r\n\r\n### Data Subject\r\n\r\nThe legal or natural person to whom the Personal Data refers.\r\n\r\n### Data Processor (or Data Supervisor)\r\n\r\nThe natural person, legal person, public administration or any other body, association or organization authorized by the Data Controller to process the Personal Data in compliance with this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nData Controller (or Owner)\r\n\r\nThe natural person, legal person, public administration or any other body, association or organization with the right, also jointly with another Data Controller, to make decisions regarding the purposes, and the methods of processing of Personal Data and the means used, including the security measures concerning the operation and use of this Application.
