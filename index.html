<a id="flickr-data-storage" class="anchor" href="#flickr-data-storage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flickr Data Storage</h3>

<p>If you don't need to back up the CoreData store, i.e., it only contains information downloaded that can be downloaded again, and doesn't contain any user content or settings, then, I would recommend you place the CoreData store in the app's cache directory instead of the documents directory. 
Storing CoreData files in the cache directory is common practice when CoreData is being used as a cache. That's exactly what that folder is for. 
See: lists.apple.com/archives/Cocoa-dev/2005/Jul/msg02544.html for more info. </p>

<p>The cache folder's contents are not backed up to iCloud.

<p>Because we are downloading images to Cache Directory Folder. Nothing is stored at Documents Folder.
When placing the CoreData store in the Documents folder, it could create additional files (binary files, log files etc), and these can grow quite large. Applying the NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey flag on the main store.

<p>Flickr does have 3 safety flags you can apply to an image:</p>

<p>Safe
Moderate
Restricted</p>

<p>Flickr have an API for reporting objectionable content
to find more information, please see here: <a href="https://info.yahoo.com/safely/us/yahoo/flickr/">https://info.yahoo.com/safely/us/yahoo/flickr/</a></p>

<p>Although people are advised to upload images with the correct safety flag already applied, sometimes they upload everything as "safe" and they change the safety flags after upload. This may be what happened in your case.</p>

<p>The Flickr rules apply only to what parts of the body are visible, and have nothing to do with "adult", "art", or "porn" designations. People are not required to flag these images as private. </p>

<p>If breasts or buttocks are visible in the image, (including tight or translucent clothing) then the image must be flagged as "moderate".
If the pubic area is visible or sexual acts are shown, the image must be flagged as "restricted". </p>

<a id="more-on-flickr-and-yahoo" class="anchor" href="#more-on-flickr-and-yahoo" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More on Flickr and Yahoo</h3>

<p>How can I remove content that isn’t suitable for all ages from my search results?</p>

<p>Not a problem! SafeSearch is a tool that lets you control what comes up in your searches on Flickr. It's already turned on by default.</p>

<p>When you first join Flickr, you’re account SafeSearch default is “safe”. You can however choose to see “moderate” content as well. Moderate? Moderate photos and videos may feature naked breasts and bare bottoms, but nothing more. Here how to make that change:</p>

<p>If you aren't signed in to Flickr, SafeSearch is always on.
If you are signed in, you can change SafeSearch included content that the community has flagged as “moderate”.
If you’re signed in, you can also set a default SafeSearch level that you'd like to use.
You can change this setting for each search on the Advanced Search page.
Note: If you are in Singapore, Hong Kong, or Korea, you will only be able to view safe content based on your local Terms of Service — you won’t be able to turn SafeSearch off.</p>

<p>And just a reminder: Be sure to report abuse if you spot any inappropriate photos or videos!</p>

<p>A few more tips:</p>

<p>Your Web address can’t be changed. Once you’ve made up your own personalized web address, you can’t change it.</p>

<p>Flickr video. You can post videos up to 90 seconds long if the content is “safe or moderate.” If you upload a video, it must be a video you created. If Flickr finds out you uploaded a restricted video or a video you didn’t create, the video will be removed and you’ll receive a warning. Not cool. If you regularly upload content that isn’t yours, you may not be able to upload anymore. If you’re a repeat abuser, your account may be deleted.</p>

<p>Copyright infringement. OK, let’s say you find photos or video that you’ve taken in someone else’s Flickr account. A lot of times, people don’t understand copyright and might have uploaded your stuff in error. Or, you can contact the Yahoo Copyright Team about filing at Notice of Infringement. Click on the “Copyright” link that’s available in the footer of ever page to find out how so your message will go to the correct Yahoo Copyright people.</p>

<p>How can I report a problem I see on Flickr?</p>

<p>It’s super easy. Try the Report Abuse link at the bottom of every page. Use it to report obscene language, offensive content, threats of violence, harassment, or anything else that violates either the Yahoo Terms of Service or Flickr’s Community Guidelines. If you click that link when you’re on the page where the content is, we’ll get the info we need to best take action.</p>

<p>Flickr’s Abuse &amp; Advocacy Team will take action as needed. They could even deactivate an abuser’s account. Yahoo’s legal team gets involved right away with reports that show child pornography or solicitation of a minor. When needed, they report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</p>

<p>What else can I do to use Flickr more safely?</p>

<p>Start by checking out our general tips for online safety. There’s a bunch of good ones, including protecting your online identity, keeping your passwords secret, being cautious about contact with strangers, and creating a family pledge for online safety. For your own safety, get to know these features and add a parent or another trusted adult as a Flickr friend so they can see what’s up.</p>

<p>Yahoo is committed to providing a safer online experience for all of us, and it complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Flickr has a number of safety features to limit your risks. However, protecting all of us is a responsibility we share with parents, teachers, and others.</p>
